# Elba - coarse-grained and hybrid simulations

Blogging and tutorials on how to setup, run and analyse simulations with the Elba and Elba/AA force fields.

The blog and other helpful sites you can reach [here](https://sgenheden.github.io/Elba/)

In this repository you find the following folders:

* CG-tutorials: tutorials on how to run Elba coarse-grained simulations

* Hybrid-tutorials: tutorials on how to run Elba/AA hybrid simulations

* Install-lammps: some notes on how to install my Lammps repository and some useful makefiles

* Liquids: pre-equilibrated membranes and pure Liquids

* Systems: various systems that have been simulated with Elba or Elba/AA, which can be used to test or benchmark new code
