# Elba - coarse-grained and hybrid simulations

Tutorials on how to setup, run and analyse simulations with the Elba and Elba/AA force fields.

In this repository you find the following folders:

* CG-tutorials: tutorials on how to run Elba coarse-grained simulations

* Hybrid-tutorials: tutorials on how to run Elba/AA hybrid simulations

* Install-lammps: some notes on how to install my Lammps repository and some useful makefiles. NB: Most of the tutorials should work with the offical Lammps version.

* Liquids: pre-equilibrated membranes and pure Liquids
