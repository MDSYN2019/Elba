# Coarse-grained ELba tutorials

This repositoty contains Lammps tutorials for simulations with the Elba model.

These tutorials assume that you have the repositories [Scripts](https://github.com/SGenheden/Scripts) and [lammps](https://github.com/SGenheden/lammps) on you machine. The former contains a number of python scripts that are used to setup, modify and analyse Lammps files. The latter one is my modifications to the Lammps code. Eventually, some of these changes will find there way into the official release of lammps.

In these tutorials, I will refer to the location of the `Scripts` folder with `$SCRIPTS`
and the location of the `lammps` folder with `$LMPPATH`.

At the moment the following tutorials are available:

* **Membrane** - simulation of a DOPC membrane with the ELBA potential

* **ElbaSolv** - solvation free energy calculation of an ELBA water in a box of ELBA water molecules
